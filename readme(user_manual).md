Overview
This project contains process of Extracting, Transforing and Loading (ETL) Major League Baseball's (MLB) Hitting and Pitching data.

This has 3 main scripts:

1. Extract.py: Downloads and reads the raw dataset
2. Transform.py : Cleans and standardizes the dataset
3. Load.py: Loads the processed data into postgreSQL tables.

Final result will be a structured databse with:

1. Master tables: stores the full cleaned dataset.
2. Query tables: generally contains selected subsets or aggregated data.

Prequisites (These need to be present in the system compulsorily):

1. Python 3.11+
2. PostgresSQL
3. PySpark

Dependencies:

1. Python os library
2. KaggleApi authenticator
3. psycopg2

Database

1. PostgreSQL server must be running
2. Connect to a database
3. Connection details, the host, user, password and database name

To download and use this ETL pipeline:

1. Go to terminal and type:
   git clone "https://github.com/SeerPant/MLB-player-performance-trends.git"

2. Run extract.py , transform.py and load.py in order.
   SEE 2.1 FOR DETAILS REGARDING THE LOADING PROCESS.
   Extract extracts the dataset from kaggle into data/raw.  
   Transform cleans the dataset, standardizes column names and saves as a parquet file in data/cleaned and data/parquet.
   Load loads the cleaned data into postgreSQL in form of master and query optimized tables.

2.1 To load into postgres, the provided credentials should match before running load.py.
DATABASE = "mlb_db" (or any name that you give)
USER = "postgres" (or any name that you give)
PASSWORD = "your password" (the password that you created)
HOST = "localhost" (or any name that you give)
PORT = "5432" (Which is the default port for postgreSQL)

3. The postgresSQL database will contatin: Master table and query tables. Which cna be checked in pgadmin by navigating to the 'localserver' -> 'Schemas' then 'tables'.

4. Conduct visualization how ever you want.
   A simple example would be to use power BI,
   load the cleaned datasets "Hitting and Pitching" from data/cleaned and create charts.
